I am a **CNRS postdoctoral researcher at Sorbonne University (Paris)**, supervised by  
<a href="https://www.ljll.fr/szeftel/index.html">Jérémie Szeftel</a>.

I received my **PhD in Mathematics from Columbia University (2025)**, where I was advised by  
<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~mtwang/">Mu-Tao Wang</a> and  
<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~egiorgi/">Elena Giorgi</a>.

I completed my undergraduate studies at **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2020)**, mentored by  
<a href="https://frederickfong.me">Frederick Fong</a>.

## Research

I work at the interface of **general relativity, geometric analysis, and nonlinear PDE**, 
with a focus on the **geometry and dynamics of black holes**, dispersive equations on curved spacetimes, 
and geometric evolution problems.
