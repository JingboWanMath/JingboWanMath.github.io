🧑‍🎓 I am a fifth year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by both [Professor Mu-Tao Wang](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~mtwang/) and [Professor Elena Giorgi](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~egiorgi/). 

🙋 I am on job market in 2024 fall.
    
🏫 I was an undergraduate student in Hong Kong University of Science and technology, supervised by [Professor Frederick Fong](https://frederickfong.me).


More about me
======

✨ My research interests are differential geometry, partial differential equation, general relativity and so on, especially various aspects of Blackholes.

📃 So far, my appeared works are about positive curved manifolds, parabolic geometric/heat flows or hyperbolic equations on blackholes:

   1. (Joint with Elena Giorgi) "Boundedness and Decay for the Teukolsky System in Kerr-Newman Spacetime II: The Case $|a|<< M, |Q| < M$ in Axial Symmetry," preprint.
   2. "Sharp Interior Gradient Estimate for Area Decreasing Graphical Mean Curvature Flow in Arbitrary Codimension," submitted.
   3. (Joint with Man-Chun Lee and Luen-Fai Tam) "Rigidity of Area Non-Increasing Maps," submitted.
   4. (Joint with Man-Chun Lee) "Rigidity of Contracting Map Using Harmonic Map Heat Flow," submitted.
   5. (Joint with Elena Giorgi) "Physical-Space Estimates for Axisymmetric Waves on Extremal Kerr Spacetime," submitted.
   6. (Joint with Florian Johne and Tsz-Kiu Aaron Chow) "Preserving Positive Intermediate Curvature," J Geom Anal 33, 366 (2023).
   7. (Joint with Nicholas Cheng-Hoong Chin and Frederick Tsz-Ho Fong) "Uniqueness Theorems of Self-Conformal Solutions to Inverse Curvature Flows," Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 148 (2020), 4967-4982.
