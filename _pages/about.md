🧑‍🎓 I am a fifth-year graduate student at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Mu-Tao Wang](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~mtwang/) and [Professor Elena Giorgi](http://www.math.columbia.edu/~egiorgi/).  

🙋 __I am on the job market for the fall of 2024.__

🏫 I completed my undergraduate studies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I was supervised by [Professor Frederick Fong](https://frederickfong.me).

## More About Me

✨ My **research interests** include differential geometry, partial differential equations, general relativity, and more, with a particular focus on various aspects of black holes.

📃 My **published works** cover topics such as positively curved manifolds, parabolic geometric/heat flows, and hyperbolic equations on black holes:

1. (Joint with Sergiu Klainerman and Dawei Shen) "A Canonical Foliation on Null Infinity in Perturbations of Kerr", arXiv:2412.20119 (gr-qc), 28 Dec 2024.
2. (Joint with Elena Giorgi) “Boundedness and Decay for the Teukolsky System in Kerr-Newman Spacetime II: The Case \( a \ll M, Q < M \) in Axial Symmetry,” preprint.
3. “Sharp Interior Gradient Estimate for Area Decreasing Graphical Mean Curvature Flow in Arbitrary Codimension,” submitted.
4. (Joint with Man-Chun Lee and Luen-Fai Tam) “Rigidity of Area Non-Increasing Maps,” accepted by *Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.*.
5. (Joint with Man-Chun Lee) “Rigidity of Contracting Maps Using Harmonic Map Heat Flow,” submitted.
6. (Joint with Elena Giorgi) “Physical-Space Estimates for Axisymmetric Waves on Extremal Kerr Spacetime,” *J. Funct. Anal.* 287 (12), 110668.
7. (Joint with Florian Johne and Tsz-Kiu Aaron Chow) “Preserving Positive Intermediate Curvature,” *J. Geom. Anal.* 33, 366 (2023).
8. (Joint with Nicholas Cheng-Hoong Chin and Frederick Tsz-Ho Fong) “Uniqueness Theorems of Self-Conformal Solutions to Inverse Curvature Flows,” *Proc. Amer. Math. Soc.* 148 (2020), 4967-4982.
