excerpt: "Construction of a canonical foliation on future null infinity for perturbations of Kerr spacetimes, yielding well-defined radiative charges."

abstract: >
  Kerr stability for small angular momentum has been established in a series
  of works by Klainerman–Szeftel, Giorgi–Klainerman–Szeftel, and Shen. Building
  on the existence and uniqueness theory of GCM spheres developed by
  Klainerman–Szeftel, we construct a canonical foliation of future null
  infinity for perturbations of Kerr spacetime. For this foliation, the null
  energy, linear momentum, center of mass, and angular momentum are
  well-defined and satisfy the expected physical laws of gravitational
  radiation. The rigidity of the construction eliminates the usual
  ambiguities present in the physics literature. We further show that, under
  the assumptions of the Kerr stability framework, the center of mass of the
  black hole undergoes a large recoil following the perturbation.
