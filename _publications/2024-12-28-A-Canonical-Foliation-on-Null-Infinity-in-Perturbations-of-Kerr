Kerr stability for small angular momentum has been proved in the series of works by Klainerman–Szeftel, Giorgi–Klainerman–Szeftel, and Shen.  

In this paper, based on the existence and uniqueness results for GCM spheres by Klainerman–Szeftel, we establish the existence of a canonical foliation on the future null infinity for which the null energy, linear momentum, center of mass, and angular momentum are well-defined and satisfy the expected physical laws of gravitational radiation. The rigid character of this foliation eliminates the usual ambiguities in the physics literature. We also show that the center of mass of the black hole undergoes a large recoil after the perturbation.
