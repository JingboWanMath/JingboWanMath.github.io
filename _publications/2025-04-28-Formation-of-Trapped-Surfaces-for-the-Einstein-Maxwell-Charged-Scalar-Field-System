excerpt: "Scale-critical formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein–Maxwell–charged scalar field system without symmetry assumptions."

abstract: >
  We prove a scale-critical trapped surface formation result for the
  Einstein–Maxwell–charged scalar field (EMCSF) system without imposing any
  symmetry assumptions. Starting from regular characteristic initial data
  prescribed at past null infinity, we establish a semi-global existence
  theorem at the critical scale and show that the focusing of gravitational
  waves, the concentration of electromagnetic fields, or the condensation of
  the complex scalar field can each independently lead to the formation of a
  trapped surface. In addition, we capture a nontrivial charging process
  occurring along past null infinity, which introduces new analytical
  difficulties due to the abnormal behavior of the matter fields. Despite
  these challenges, both the semi-global existence result and the trapped
  surface formation remain valid.
