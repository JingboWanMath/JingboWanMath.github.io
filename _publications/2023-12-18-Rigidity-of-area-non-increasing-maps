excerpt: "Rigidity results for area non-increasing maps between compact manifolds with positive curvature."

abstract: >
  In this work, we study area non-increasing maps between manifolds with positive
  curvature. By employing the strong maximum principle along the graphical mean
  curvature flow, we show that such maps are either homotopically trivial,
  Riemannian submersions, local isometries, or isometric immersions, confirming
  a conjecture of Tsai–Tsui–Wang.

  In addition, we combine Brendle’s sphere theorem with the mean curvature flow
  coupled to the Ricci flow to establish related rigidity results on manifolds
  with positive \(1\)-isotropic curvature.
