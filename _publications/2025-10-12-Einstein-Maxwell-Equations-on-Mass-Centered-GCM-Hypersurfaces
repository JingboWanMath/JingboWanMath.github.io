excerpt: "Solving the Einstein–Maxwell equations on mass-centered GCM hypersurfaces as a step toward nonlinear stability of charged black holes."

abstract: >
  The resolution of the nonlinear stability problem for black holes as
  solutions of the Einstein equations relies crucially on imposing appropriate
  geometric gauge conditions. In the vacuum setting, the use of Generally
  Covariant Modulated (GCM) spheres and hypersurfaces has played a central role
  in the proof of stability for slowly rotating Kerr spacetime. In the charged
  setting, electromagnetic–gravitational coupling destroys the exceptional
  structure exploited in the vacuum analysis, requiring a modified framework.

  In this work, we solve the Einstein–Maxwell equations on a mass-centered
  spacelike GCM hypersurface, which is equivalent to solving the constraint
  equations there. We control all geometric quantities of the solution in terms
  of suitable seed data corresponding to gauge-invariant fields describing
  coupled gravitational–electromagnetic radiation in perturbations of
  Reissner–Nordström or Kerr–Newman spacetimes. These fields, first identified
  by the second author, are expected to satisfy favorable hyperbolic equations.
  This result provides a first step toward controlling gauge-dependent
  quantities in the nonlinear stability analysis of the Reissner–Nordström and
  Kerr–Newman families.
