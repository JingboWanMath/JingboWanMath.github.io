excerpt: "Cauchy initial data for the Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon system whose evolution leads to the formation of multiple trapped surfaces."

abstract: >
  We construct Cauchy initial data for the Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon (EMKG)
  system that evolve in finite time into spacetimes containing multiple trapped
  surfaces. From a physical perspective, this corresponds to preparing multiple
  well-separated boson stars, each of which collapses to form a spacelike black
  hole region.

  In particular, this work extends earlier results on the formation of multiple
  trapped surfaces in vacuum to the Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon system.
