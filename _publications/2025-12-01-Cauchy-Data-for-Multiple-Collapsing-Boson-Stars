We construct Cauchy initial data for the Einstein–Maxwell–Klein–Gordon (EMKG) system that evolve in finite time into spacetimes containing multiple trapped surfaces. From a physical perspective, this corresponds to preparing multiple well-separated boson stars, each of which collapses to form a spacelike black hole region.

In particular, this work extends the results of the second and third named authors on the formation of multiple trapped surfaces in vacuum to the EMKG system.
