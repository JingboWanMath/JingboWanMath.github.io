excerpt: "Deformation and non-existence results for metrics with positive intermediate curvature under natural boundary conditions."

abstract: >
  Consider a compact manifold \(N\) (with or without boundary) of dimension
  \(n\). Positive \(m\)-intermediate curvature interpolates between positive
  Ricci curvature (\(m=1\)) and positive scalar curvature (\(m=n-1\)), and it is
  obstructed on partial tori
  \(N^n = M^{n-m} \times \mathbb{T}^m\).

  Given Riemannian metrics \(g, \tilde g\) on \((N, \partial N)\) with positive
  \(m\)-intermediate curvature and \(m\)-positive difference
  \(h_g - h_{\tilde g}\) of second fundamental forms, we show that there exists a
  smooth family of Riemannian metrics with positive \(m\)-intermediate curvature
  interpolating between \(g\) and \(\tilde g\).

  Moreover, we apply this result to prove a non-existence theorem for partial
  torical bands with positive \(m\)-intermediate curvature and strictly
  \(m\)-convex boundaries.
