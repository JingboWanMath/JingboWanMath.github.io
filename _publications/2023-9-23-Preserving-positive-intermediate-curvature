Consider a compact manifold \(N\) (with or without boundary) of dimension \(n\). Positive \(m\)-intermediate curvature interpolates between positive Ricci curvature (\(m=1\)) and positive scalar curvature (\(m=n-1\)), and it is obstructed on partial tori \(N^n=M^{n-m} \times \mathbb{T}^m\).  

Given Riemannian metrics \(g, \tilde{g}\) on \((N, \partial N)\) with positive \(m\)-intermediate curvature and \(m\)-positive difference \(h_g - h_{\tilde{g}}\) of second fundamental forms, we show that there exists a smooth family of Riemannian metrics with positive \(m\)-intermediate curvature interpolating between \(g\) and \(\tilde{g}\).  

Moreover, we apply this result to prove a non-existence result for partial torical bands with positive \(m\)-intermediate curvature and strictly \(m\)-convex boundaries.
