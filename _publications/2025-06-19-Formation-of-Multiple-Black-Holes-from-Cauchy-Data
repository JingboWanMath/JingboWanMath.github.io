excerpt: "Vacuum initial data without trapped surfaces whose evolution forms multiple causally independent black holes."

abstract: >
  We construct a class of smooth, asymptotically flat Cauchy initial data for
  the Einstein vacuum equations that contain no trapped surfaces, but whose
  future development leads in finite time to the formation of multiple
  causally independent trapped surfaces and hence multiple black holes.
  The construction may be viewed as a relativistic analogue of $N$-body
  initial data: the black holes are not present initially and are not glued
  in \emph{a priori}, but instead arise dynamically from regular vacuum data
  through gravitational collapse. The construction combines Christodoulou’s
  short-pulse method with a surgical gluing procedure for the constraint
  equations, remaining exactly Brill–Lindquist outside localized regions.
