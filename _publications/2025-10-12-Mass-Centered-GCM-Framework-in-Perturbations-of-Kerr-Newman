excerpt: "A mass-centered GCM framework adapted to nonlinear stability problems for Reissner–Nordström and Kerr–Newman spacetimes."

abstract: >
  The nonlinear stability problem for black hole solutions of the Einstein
  equations critically depends on choosing an appropriate geometric gauge. In
  the vacuum setting, the use of Generally Covariant Modulated (GCM) spheres and
  hypersurfaces has played a central role in the proof of stability for slowly
  rotating Kerr spacetime. In the charged setting, electromagnetic–gravitational
  coupling destroys the exceptional behavior of the $\ell=1$ center-of-mass
  mode exploited in the vacuum analysis, causing the standard GCM construction
  to break down.

  In this work, we develop an alternative GCM framework, which we call
  mass-centered, designed to overcome this difficulty and aimed at the
  nonlinear stability of Reissner–Nordström and Kerr–Newman spacetimes. Our
  approach replaces transport-based control of the center-of-mass quantity with
  a sphere-wise vanishing condition imposed on a renormalized $\ell=1$ mode,
  yielding mass-centered GCM hypersurfaces with modified gauge constraints. The
  resulting elliptic–transport system remains determined once an $\ell=1$ basis
  is fixed via effective uniformization, and it provides an alternative
  construction even in the vacuum (uncharged) limit.
