excerpt: "Rigidity of round spheres as self-conformal solutions to inverse curvature flows."

abstract: >
  It is known from the literature that round spheres are the only closed homothetic
  self-similar solutions to the inverse mean curvature flow and parabolic curvature
  flows defined by degree $-1$ homogeneous functions of principal curvatures in
  Euclidean space. In this article, we prove a stronger rigidity result: under
  natural conditions such as star-shapedness, round spheres are the only closed
  solutions to the aforementioned flows that evolve by diffeomorphisms generated by
  conformal Killing fields.
