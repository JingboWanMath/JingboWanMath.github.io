**Abstract:**  
It is known from the literature that round spheres are the only closed homothetic self-similar solutions to the inverse mean curvature flow and parabolic curvature flows defined by degree -1 homogeneous functions of principal curvatures in Euclidean space.  

In this article, we prove a stronger rigidity result: under natural conditions such as star-shapedness, round spheres are the only closed solutions to the aforementioned flows that evolve by diffeomorphisms generated by conformal Killing fields.
