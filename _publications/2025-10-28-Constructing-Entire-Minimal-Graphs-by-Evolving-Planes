excerpt: "An evolving-plane ansatz reducing the minimal surface system to a Grassmannian geodesic equation, yielding explicit entire minimal graphs in arbitrary codimension."

abstract: >
  We introduce an evolving-plane ansatz for the explicit construction of entire
  minimal graphs of dimension $n$ ($n \ge 3$) and codimension $m$ ($m \ge 2$),
  for any odd integer $n$. Under this ansatz, the minimal surface system reduces
  to the geodesic equation on the Grassmannian in affine coordinates. From a
  geometric perspective, this equation governs how the slope of an
  $(n-1)$-plane evolves as it sweeps out a minimal graph.

  This framework yields a rich family of explicit entire minimal graphs of odd
  dimension $n$ and arbitrary codimension $m$. Moreover, for each such entire
  minimal graph, its conormal bundle gives rise to an entire special Lagrangian
  graph in $\mathbb{C}^{n+m}$.
