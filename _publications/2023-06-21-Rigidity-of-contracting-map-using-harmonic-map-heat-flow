excerpt: "Rigidity results for contracting maps between positively curved manifolds via the harmonic map heat flow."

abstract: >
  Motivated by recent work of Tsai–Tsui–Wang, we study rigidity phenomena for
  maps between compact manifolds with positive curvature. We show that a
  distance non-increasing map between complex projective spaces is either an
  isometry or homotopically trivial. The rigidity result extends to a broader
  class of manifolds with positive curvature under a weaker contracting
  condition, interpolating between distance non-increasing and area
  non-increasing. The analysis is based on the harmonic map heat flow.
