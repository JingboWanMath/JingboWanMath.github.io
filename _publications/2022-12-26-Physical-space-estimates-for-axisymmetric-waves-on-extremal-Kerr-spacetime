We study axisymmetric solutions to the wave equation on extremal Kerr backgrounds and obtain integrated local energy decay (or Morawetz estimates) through an analysis conducted *exclusively in physical space*. The boundedness of the energy and Morawetz estimates for axisymmetric waves in extremal Kerr were first obtained by Aretakis through frequency-localized currents, which were used to express the trapping degeneracy. Here, we extend to extremal Kerr a method introduced by Stogin in the sub-extremal case, simplifying Aretakis' derivation of Morawetz estimates through purely classical currents.
