excerpt: "Physical-space Morawetz estimates for axisymmetric solutions of the wave equation on extremal Kerr spacetimes."

abstract: >
  We study axisymmetric solutions to the wave equation on extremal Kerr
  backgrounds and obtain integrated local energy decay (Morawetz estimates)
  through an analysis conducted exclusively in physical space. The boundedness
  of the energy and Morawetz estimates for axisymmetric waves in extremal Kerr
  were first obtained by Aretakis through frequency-localized currents, which
  were used to express the trapping degeneracy. Here, we extend to extremal Kerr
  a method introduced by Stogin in the sub-extremal case, simplifying Aretakis'
  derivation of Morawetz estimates through purely classical currents.
