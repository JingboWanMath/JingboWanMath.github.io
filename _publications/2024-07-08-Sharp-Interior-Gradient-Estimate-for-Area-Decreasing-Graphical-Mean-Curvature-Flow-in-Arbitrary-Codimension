excerpt: "Sharp interior gradient estimates for area-decreasing graphical mean curvature flow in arbitrary codimension."

abstract: >
  We establish a sharp interior gradient estimate for area-decreasing
  graphical mean curvature flow in arbitrary codimension. The result
  generalizes the classical interior gradient estimate for codimension one
  to higher codimension settings under the natural area-decreasing
  condition, extending earlier work in the literature.
