excerpt: "Vacuum asymptotically flat initial data at minimal and borderline decay thresholds via conical solution operators."

abstract: >
  In this note, we show that the conical solution-operator method of Mao-Tao in
  [Localized initial data for Einstein equations] applies to a simple construction
  of vacuum asymptotically flat initial data at minimal and borderline decay
  thresholds, corresponding to the global and exterior stability of Minkowski
  spacetime proved by the first named author in [Global stability of Minkowski
  spacetime with minimal decay] and [Exterior stability of Minkowski spacetime
  with borderline decay].
