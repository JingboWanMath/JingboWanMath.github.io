excerpt: "Boundedness and decay for the Teukolsky system on slowly rotating, strongly charged Kerr–Newman spacetimes in axial symmetry."

abstract: >
  We establish boundedness and polynomial decay results for the Teukolsky
  system in the exterior spacetime of very slowly rotating and strongly
  charged sub-extremal Kerr–Newman black holes, with a focus on axially
  symmetric solutions. A key step in achieving these results is the derivation
  of a physical-space Morawetz estimate for the associated generalized
  Regge–Wheeler system, avoiding the use of spherical harmonic decomposition.
