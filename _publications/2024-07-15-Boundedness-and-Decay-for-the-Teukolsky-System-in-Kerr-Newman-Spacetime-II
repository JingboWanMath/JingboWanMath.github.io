We establish boundedness and polynomial decay results for the Teukolsky system in the exterior spacetime of very slowly rotating and strongly charged sub-extremal Kerr–Newman black holes, with a focus on axially symmetric solutions. A key step in achieving these results is deriving a physical-space Morawetz estimate for the associated generalized Regge–Wheeler system, avoiding the use of spherical harmonic decomposition.
