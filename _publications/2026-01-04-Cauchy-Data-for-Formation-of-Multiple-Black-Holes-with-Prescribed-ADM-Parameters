excerpt: "Vacuum Cauchy initial data whose evolution leads to the formation of multiple black holes with independently prescribed ADM parameters."

abstract: >
  We construct smooth, asymptotically flat vacuum Cauchy initial data modeling a
  relativistic collapsing $N$--body system, with independently prescribed ADM
  energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum for each component, subject to the
  timelike condition $\E > |\P|$.

  The initial data contain no trapped surfaces. Nevertheless, their maximal
  future development contains multiple causally independent trapped regions that
  dynamically form from localized subsets of the initial slice. In particular,
  for well-separated collapsing components with relative motion, the evolution is
  expected to produce spacetimes containing multiple black holes.
