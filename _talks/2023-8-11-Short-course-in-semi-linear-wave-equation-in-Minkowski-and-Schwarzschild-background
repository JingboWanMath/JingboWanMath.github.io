Lecture series on semi-linear wave equation in Minkowski and Schwarzschild background:
  - On 11/8, we discuss semi-linear wave equations in Minkowski - Energy type estimate
  - On 18/8, we discuss semi-linear wave equations in Minkowski - Dynamic estimate & Global decay
  - On 25/8, we discuss semi-linear wave equations in Schwarzschild - Morawetz estimate
  - On 1/9, we disucss the recent development of Dawei Shen on Exterior stability of Minkowski using Dafermos-Rodnianski's r^p estimate. (cancelled due to Typhoon)
